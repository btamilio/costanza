COSTANZA
===============
### Uncanny AI Poetry 
This is a work-in-progress sample codebase; the intended audience is potential employers. The application runs, but it requires OpenAI API access.



### Running it locally
This is your basic [Laravel](https://laravel.com/) PHP application. You'll need, minimally, a running local PHP environment ([Herd ](https://herd.laravel.com/) and [Valet](https://laravel.com/docs/11.x/valet) are useful), a [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/) database, an [Open AI API Token](https://openai.com/api/), and the ability to run command line scripts. You'll also need some way to send email. All of these items are configurable in the .env file you'll create from [.env.example](https://github.com/btamilio/costanza/blob/main/.env.example). If you're scratching your head right now, you may want to read up on Laravel [configuration ](https://laravel.com/docs/11.x/configuration).

After all that is in place, run the new-standards of:

1. npm install
2. composer install
3. php artisan migrate
4. php artisan db:seed

_more to come..._
